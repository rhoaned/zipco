# ZipCo Analysis
This repository is aimed at highlighting the current position ZipCo currently has within the 'Buy Now Pay Later' industry.

## Overview and Origin:

ZipCo was orignially founded in 2013 by Peter Gray and Larry Diamond. The idea to create Zip was arguably caused by both of the founders realising that after the GFC had occured that there was a gap in the market for providing loans to consumers who didn't want to use the traditional financing activities such as using credit cards. The company was initially funded through private funding rounds before going public in September 2015 to raise the capital required to finance operations for the next 2 years. Total funding recieved from financing activities to date is over $500 Million AUD and there has been very little capital raised through investment operations.

## Business Activites:

ZipCo has been trying to solve the problem which arguably a large portion of young Australians currently have. This problem is gaining access to a line of credit from traditional financiers such as a bank or credit card provider. To solve this problem ZipCo offers a range of products which allows the facilitation of consumers to purchase goods by paying a fraction of the price upfront then the remainder through regular instalments which are ‘interest free’. In saying this the predominant user base for these types of products are a younger demographic of people. This younger demographic of people which makes up most of the BNPL customer base is also female. 
Using comparative analysis between credit cards and a BNPL option is that the BNPL space does not come under the same lending laws which credit card providers have to adhere by. Through these ‘loopholes’ in current regulation it facilitates instant loans to its customers which potentially has been a massive driver for its adoption through the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it would noted that within the traditional banking space they have launched their own products and increasing pressure from rising interest rates and other environmental factors will potentially give BNPL companies more rising costs to continue operating which arguably will eventually outrun their investors’ appetite for continued investment.
While there has been no direct addressing to the technology ZipCo uses to facilitate their operations, using their online job advertising board we can see the types of systems/coding languages they use or want to use on a day-to-day basis such as:
-	Python
-	Scala
-	SQL
-	C#
They also use multiple environments and databases to facilitate operations such as Azure DWH, SqlServer, Postgresql. 

## Landscape:

ZipCo is currently a company which operates within the Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) industry in Australia which is also identified as a lending domain within the FinTech space as well. It is arguable that there haven’t been any major innovations out of this industry over the last 5 – 10 years. However, there have been a noticeable number of major trends to come out of the industry within the last 5 years and especially over the last 2 years with online shopping having incredible amounts of impact on these trends. These major trends include a significant amount of adoption of BNPL products which has coincided with the rise of ecommerce platforms as well as consumers looking for alternative ways to purchase goods online and in store. Other notable BNPL organisations within this space are Flexigroup (Humm and Humm90) and AfterPay. However, this space will continue to have a lot of new competitors attempt to gain market share, such as the Big 4 banks, as they attempt to regain some market share they have lost from credit card operations.
 

## Results:

ZipCo has come a long way since its inception in 2013 to provide consumers an alternative way to finance their purchases. The impact of this business has been felt in many industries including traditional financial institutions, ecommerce and credit card providers. Overall, this company and the industry it is in, are still yet to show profitability on their revenues and is heavily reliant on their financiers to continue operations so its impact could be far greater if they default or continue their cash burn rate. To measure the relative success of the ZipCo in the BNPL space could potentially be measured through a plethora of financial, social and stakeholder analysis. However, for the purpose of this report we are strictly going to use financial metrics to measure performance. ZipCo has not turned a profit since operations began but has continued to focus on customer acquisition strategies in hopes that one day, they will turn a profit once growth starts to stabilize and they enter a mature stage within the business life cycle. In terms of these metrics ZipCo is second largest BNPL company within the space behind AfterPay. If ZipCo’s global expansion and continued customer growth outpaces their competitors there could be an argument that ZipCo becomes one of the largest BNPL players within the space globally.

## Recommendations:

Based on their current limitations within the lending space and the role legislation has it would recommend they get correct financial licenses required to offer banking services. If they are unable to acquire the correct licenses to carry out this process it would recommend allowing for customers to deposit money into their app to use for future purchases but are unable to withdraw from the ‘virtual wallet’ which also circumnavigates current legislation surrounding banking. Through implementing these changes, it will allow for them to have greater working capital needed to continue rapid expansion across the world. 
There would be very little to no development required to implement these changes and would be a new dashboard within their app to show customers the amount of money they have available to spend with their partner vendors. Again, to develop this they would use current languages and environments which they already use to avoid overcomplexity.
-	Python
-	Scala
-	SQL
-	C#
They also use multiple environments and databases to facilitate operations such as Azure DWH, SqlServer, Postgresql.
